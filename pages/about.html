                <section>
                    <h3>Early Fascination with Technology and RC Racing</h3>
                    <p>From a young age, I was drawn to technology. My interests ranged from sports cars and monster trucks to the intricacies of computing. My dad taught me the basics of DOS, where I learned to navigate the terminal, setting a foundation in computers that continued with the release of Windows 95 and early experience with a dot matrix printer.</p>
                    <p>RC racing was the first technical arena where I could dive into hands-on engineering. At seven, I learned to solder my own battery packs to optimize power—an essential skill as servo-based speed controllers evolved into digital, graphite parts gained popularity, and brushless DC motors became the standard for speed.</p>

                    <h3>Hands-On Experience at Sears Auto Center</h3>
                    <p>Before heading to college, I worked as a mechanic at Sears Auto Center, where I gained practical experience across a range of automotive tasks. I handled everything from changing tires, batteries, and oil, to performing coolant exchanges, brake replacements, rotor work, and even complex repairs like water pumps and timing belts. This role solidified my hands-on skills and my appreciation for mechanical systems, setting a strong foundation for my engineering studies.</p>

                    <h3>Pursuing Mechanical Engineering at CSU Northridge</h3>
                    <p>My fascination with engineering led me to pursue a Mechanical Engineering degree at California State University, Northridge. During this time, I balanced my passion for technology with academic rigor, often the only mechanical engineer with a MacBook Pro, running Windows through Boot Camp despite compatibility challenges. Through collaborative projects, I strengthened my skills in core engineering principles like Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics.</p>

                    <h3>Senior Project: Pivot to Software Development with IGV</h3>
                    <p>In my senior year, I led a team project, the Intelligent Ground Vehicle (IGV), where we developed algorithms for a GPS-guided vehicle capable of navigating terrain autonomously. My primary role involved selecting camera hardware and developing vision algorithms in LabVIEW to detect white lines on grass under varying conditions and environmental factors.</p>

                    <h3>Starting My Career at Flometrics and Chilldyne: Embedded Development</h3>
                    <p>Flometrics hired me as a LabVIEW and electrical engineer, and this was where I delved into embedded development. I taught myself C, progressing from understanding variable types to building non-blocking state machines and recovery systems within an RTOS environment. A standout project was developing multi-stage pump control software for a DARPA project.</p>
                    <p>During my time at Flometrics, they launched a sister company, Chilldyne, which focused on liquid cooling systems for data centers. I joined Chilldyne, where I transitioned to embedded development, working on control systems for liquid cooling applications. I designed non-blocking state machines and real-time monitoring systems to manage coolant flow, optimize temperature control, and maintain safe operational conditions. My work at Chilldyne combined my passion for hands-on engineering with complex software development, allowing me to contribute to innovative cooling solutions for high-performance computing.</p>

                    <h3>Transition to Nordson: Reliability Engineering and Statistical Modeling</h3>
                    <p>Joining Nordson as a Reliability Engineer was a technical shift, where I applied statistical analysis to hardware design. I built test benches, performed Weibull analysis, and created comprehensive reliability models using BlockSIM. My work earned recognition, including an award from Nordson’s CEO for a metrology system I designed, which transformed production capabilities.</p>

                    <h3>Returning to Software with MARCH Product Line Ownership</h3>
                    <p>After several years at Nordson, an opportunity emerged to lead software development for the MARCH product line. I stepped into the role of team lead, managing both development and DevOps. Over the past three years, I’ve overseen the development of a system that delivers high uptime and reduced maintenance, while leading rigorous testing cycles to ensure reliability.</p>

                    <h3>Passion Projects: Meditation App and Personal Portfolio</h3>
                    <p><strong>Meditation App:</strong> I developed an iOS app with SwiftUI that offers a customizable meditation experience, complete with background videos, soundscapes, and a bottom navigation bar.</p>
                    <p><strong>Portfolio Website:</strong> My personal site, Dreblow Designs, is hosted on my self-managed Ubuntu server. I configured Docker, Nginx, and backend support to handle media content and interactive features. The website’s design allows for future scalability, with a Portfolio page featuring video examples of my work.</p>
