            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello World! I'm Derek Dreblow, a passionate Software Developer based in San Diego, CA. With a solid foundation in mechanical engineering from California State University Northridge, I've transitioned into the tech world, where I combine my engineering skills with my love for software development to build innovative solutions.</p>
            
            <p>My career journey began in the field of reliability engineering, where I focused on enhancing product robustness and performance through rigorous testing and analysis. As I progressed to roles in software development, I found my true calling. At Nordson MARCH, I orchestrate software projects that drive the capabilities of plasma product lines to new heights. My work involves everything from system architecture to API development, and I thrive on turning complex problems into elegantly designed software solutions.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid learner who's always tinkering with new technologies. Whether it's exploring the latest in machine vision or optimizing automation workflows, I'm continually pushing the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not coding or debugging systems, I enjoy hiking the scenic trails around San Diego and immersing myself in the vibrant local tech community.</p>
            
            <p>I invite you to browse my portfolio to see the projects that I've brought to life. Let's connect and explore how we can create something great together.</p>
